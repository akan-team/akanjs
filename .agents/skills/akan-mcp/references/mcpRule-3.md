## Writing `instructions`

`*.abstract.md` never reaches an MCP client, and `<Agent.Guide>` only through an MCP App's view, from inside the app's
element, beside the tools it explains. Exactly these texts reach every client: `instructions`, every published entry's
`.desc()`, and a page's `.prompt()` and `.app()` descriptions. All are English, whatever the users speak
— the reader is a model, and the catalogue is built once in one `language` and cached by clients.

- **`instructions` is the workflow.** Five to eight sentences, in this order: what the app is and what its nouns
  mean; **which tool to call first** and which ids the rest take; how a name becomes an id; what a write confirms
  before it runs and which writes cannot be undone; what this server does *not* do and where that is done instead.

  ```ts
  instructions: [
    "Operations tools for a back-office that runs consulting projects.",
    "An org is one company; a project belongs to an org; a ticket is one unit of work on a project.",
    "Start from orgInSelf, then projectInOrg and ticketInProject; every other tool takes the ids those return.",
    "Prefer ticketStatusInProject for 'how is it going' and ticketInProject only when the user asks for detail.",
    "createTicket, startTicket and completeTicket write on the caller's behalf: confirm the project and title first.",
    "Nothing here signs, invoices or uploads a file; those are deliberate acts on the record's own page.",
  ].join(" "),
  ```
- **`.desc()` is the reason to pick one tool** — what it returns and when to use it, two clauses. An id argument's
  `.desc()` names the tool that returns it (`From projectInOrg`). The generated CRUD borrows the model's `.of()`
  label and `.desc()`, which is the only text those entries can carry.
- **A page prompt is a workflow the user invokes** as a slash command, not one the model chooses — a weekly
  report, an onboarding check. Its instruction is the `.prompt()` description alone and its attachments are what
  the screen fetched, masked by their return models — so to change what a prompt hands the model, change what the
  screen loads, and keep the description to the ask.
- **An app is a tool the model picks**, like a read endpoint: its description says what the component shows and for
  which arguments (`Show one ticket with its status and assignee.`), and the model reads the briefing of what its load
  fetched whether or not the host draws the view.

## Verifying An App

- `akan verify <app>`, then the boot log above.
- The lib's own suites run wherever it is mounted: the OAuth signal test (metadata, registration, both `authorize`
  redirects, code exchange, `/mcp` with the minted token and the refusal of a first-party or forged one, refresh
  rotation) and the refresh-session and option unit tests.
- **One exposure test per app**, in `srvkit/mcpExposure.signal.test.ts`, since it spans every module: list
  `tools/list` with a user token and pin the names with `toEqual`, and assert the curated and admin-only ones with
  `not.toContain`. Exposure is derived from the guards, so a guard change fails this test first — which is the point.
  The framework's own pattern is `pkgs/akanjs/server/mcp/mcp.integration.test.ts`.
- Live: connect a client, consent, call a tool, `claude mcp logout`, authenticate again. `AKAN_PUBLIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug`
  prints one `OAuth token request grant_type=… client_id=…` line per token call; two refreshes in the same second
  both answering 200 is the grace window working, not a fault.
