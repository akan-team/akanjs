## Binary Pubsub

- **`pubsub(Binary)` sends its payload in a websocket binary frame**, skipping the JSON `{ type: "pub" }`
  envelope and the base64 a JSON wire would need. The client's subscribe callback receives a `Uint8Array`.
  Nothing else is declared: the return type is the whole switch, and text and binary frames coexist on one
  socket, so every JSON endpoint is untouched. The optimization applies only when the **whole** return is
  `Binary` — `[Binary]`, or a `Binary` inside a model, falls back to base64.
- **A declared `Binary` room coalesces under backpressure**: while a socket cannot keep up the room keeps only
  its newest frame and drops the rest, which is what a telemetry or video stream wants. Declare
  `pubsub(Binary, { backpressure: "queue" })` when the frames are a sequence a subscriber must see in full, such
  as deltas against a base it already holds; the send buffer then grows with the slowest subscriber. Coalescing
  is keyed by the endpoint, not carried with the frame, so this process, an IPC deliver and a Redis fan-out all
  reach the same answer. Coalesced frames are counted in `pubsubCoalesceCount` on the replica's metrics report.
- **A `pubsub(Any)` that happens to carry bytes is framed too, and warns once.** `Any` passes a `Buffer` through
  untouched, so the transport sees bytes and sends them whole rather than as a number array — an undeclared
  publisher is fixed rather than left corrupt. It is still not the contract: it queues rather than coalescing
  (nobody declared lossy delivery for that room), and a Redis fan-out still JSON-stringifies it. Declare
  `Binary`.
- The federation gateway relays a binary frame unchanged, and Bun IPC carries bytes as bytes, so the only hop
  that needed teaching was the socket itself. A cross-server (Redis) fan-out encodes it as protobuf `bytes`.

## Mutation HTTP Verb

- A `mutation` is `POST`. `{ method: "PATCH" | "PUT" | "DELETE" }` moves it, and one path may carry several verbs
  — a `query` GET and a `mutation` POST on the same custom `path` are mounted side by side. Two endpoints claiming
  the same path **and** verb fail the boot rather than silently shadowing one another.
- Reach for it only when a foreign wire protocol forces the verb (a client you cannot change that sends
  `PATCH /rest/v1/<table>`). Akan's own `fetch.*` client, the OpenAPI document, and the API explorer all follow
  whatever is declared, so nothing needs restating per caller.
