# Akan.js Monorepo — Agent Guide

This is the canonical, tool-neutral guide for coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and others)
working in this repository. It consolidates the rules in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, which remain the
Cursor-native copies. Keep this file as the single source of truth: `CLAUDE.md` imports it, and when a
rule changes, update it here and mirror it into the matching `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` file.

## Repo Overview

- Akan.js is a full-stack TypeScript framework for building all-stack applications at once.
- Write one line and deploy across web, app, server, database, and infrastructure.
- Akan prioritizes actual business code by abstracting technical implementation details as much as possible.
- The goal is minimal code, high performance, and type-safe services that can deploy to web, mobile, server, and DB infrastructure together.
- This is a Bun-first Akan.js monorepo.
- Main top-level areas are `apps/`, `libs/`, `pkgs/`, and `infra/`.
- `apps/<app>` contains app-level pages, domain code, UI, env files, and `akan.config.ts`.
- `libs/*` contains shared domain and utility libraries.
- `pkgs/akanjs/*` contains framework, runtime, and tooling facets published through the single `akanjs` package. Prefer extending existing Akan facets before adding new framework-level patterns.
- `infra/` contains Helm, deployment templates, edge configs, and Jenkins env/secret scripts.

## Change Scope

- Keep edits scoped to the requested task and the directly related files.
- Do not reformat unrelated files or rewrite nearby code just for style.
- Do not revert or overwrite unrelated user changes in a dirty working tree.
- Prefer established nearby patterns over introducing a new abstraction.
- Add new abstractions only when they remove real duplication or match an existing project pattern.

## Coding Style (`**/*.{ts,tsx}`)

- For large units of work, prefer declaring a class and running the flow through an instance instead of scattering many standalone functions.
- Prefer class methods or `static` methods over unrelated top-level helper functions when the logic belongs to a class-level workflow.
- Prefer ECMAScript `#private` fields and methods over TypeScript `private`; `*.service.ts` files are the main exception where `private` methods are encouraged.
- In files that declare a class, avoid top-level functions or variables when they can reasonably live inside the class.
- Prefer `const` function expressions over `function` declarations unless hoisting, overloads, generators, or framework conventions make `function` the better fit.
- Prefer declaring only one class per file; split the file when two or more class declarations are needed.
- For class-centered modules, prefer noun-style filenames that match the primary class name, such as `RouteClientBuilder.ts`, instead of verb-style wrapper filenames like `buildRouteClient.ts`.
- Avoid keeping exported functions that only instantiate a class and immediately call one method. Prefer migrating callers to instantiate the class directly.
- Except for React component files or convention files, TypeScript filenames should use camelCase.
- In React components, keep one-off `className` strings inline. Only extract class name constants when the class is reused, conditionally composed, or too large to read comfortably in JSX.

### Test Code

- Write TypeScript tests with Bun's test runner and import `describe`, `expect`, and `test` from `bun:test`.
- Keep tests colocated with the source they cover using `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`, following the existing nearby pattern.
- Prefer focused behavior tests for public contracts and edge cases over implementation-detail assertions.

## TypeScript And Imports (`**/*.{ts,tsx}`)

- Use Bun and ESM assumptions from the root `tsconfig.json`.
- Prefer path aliases over deep relative imports when crossing package boundaries.
- Use `akanjs/*` for framework facets, `@apps/*` for apps, `@libs/*` for shared libs, and `@contract/*` for contract code.
- Respect existing client/server entrypoints such as `@libs/shared/client`, `@libs/shared/server`, `@apps/akasys/client`, and `@apps/akasys/server`.
- Let Biome organize imports instead of manually reshuffling unrelated imports.

## Formatting And Linting

- Use Biome as the formatter and linter.
- Format with `bun run akan lint <appName>` from the repo root.
- Keep formatting consistent with `biome.json`: 2-space indentation, 120 line width, and double quotes for JS/TS.
- Avoid adding new `console` usage except accepted methods such as `console.error`, `console.info`, and `console.warn`.
- Do not make broad formatting-only changes in unrelated files.

## Client / Server Boundaries (`apps/**`, `libs/**`, `pkgs/akanjs/**`)

- Use `"use client";` at the top of client component files.
- Be careful when importing client-only code from page or layout modules.
- Keep page props serializable unless the existing route pattern clearly allows otherwise.
- In domain UI, `Template`, `Zone`, and `Util` components are usually client components; `Unit` and `View` components are usually server components.
- Preserve established domain file roles such as `.document.ts`, `.service.ts`, `.store.ts`, `.constant.ts`, and `.client.ts`.
- When unsure, inspect nearby files in the same app or package before introducing a new boundary pattern.

## Domain Module Conventions (`apps/**/lib/**`, `libs/**/lib/**`)

- Organize business concepts as domain folders under `lib/`; keep related schema, service, signal, store, and UI files together.
- Use lowercase logic files such as `<model>.constant.ts`, `<model>.document.ts`, `<model>.service.ts`, `<model>.signal.ts`, `<model>.dictionary.ts`, and `<model>.store.ts`.
- Use PascalCase React component files such as `<Model>.Template.tsx`, `<Model>.Unit.tsx`, `<Model>.View.tsx`, `<Model>.Zone.tsx`, and `<Model>.Util.tsx`.
- Treat `constant.ts`, `dictionary.ts`, and `signal.ts` as shared contract files that should avoid platform-specific dependencies.
- Keep backend persistence/query logic in `.document.ts` and domain business orchestration in `.service.ts`.
- Keep frontend state in `.store.ts`; use `Template` for forms, `Unit` for list/card items, `View` for details, `Zone` for composed page sections, and `Util` for domain-specific UI helpers.

## Service And Signal Conventions (`*.{service,signal}.ts`, `server/**`)

- Keep domain business operations in `.service.ts` classes built with `serve(...)`.
- Keep execution contracts and triggers in `.signal.ts` classes built with `internal(...)`, `slice(...)`, and `endpoint(...)`.
- Use `Internal` for internal triggers such as init, interval, cron, or queue jobs.
- Use `Slice` for typed data views that feed client stores and zones; keep each slice focused on one purpose.
- Use `Endpoint` for query and mutation contracts exposed to callers.
- Connect external APIs or infrastructure through adapters, usually under `srvkit/`, and inject them into services instead of importing vendor clients directly into domain logic.

### Signal Body Types

- `.body(...)` / `.param(...)` args accept `ConstantFieldTypeInput` only: scalars, model refs, or `enumOf(...)`.
- Numbers must use `Int` or `Float` — `Number` is rejected (`pkgs/akanjs/signal/endpointInfo.ts`).
- `Upload` is valid only inside a mutation flagged for file upload: `mutation([cnst.File], { fileUpload: true }).body("files", [Upload])` (see `libs/shared/lib/file/file.signal.ts`). It is not a model field type.

### Reserved Endpoint Names

- Auto-generated CRUD endpoints (e.g. `create<Model>`, `update<Model>`, `remove<Model>`) already exist for every model. Do not declare an `Endpoint`/`Slice` with a name that collides with them.
- The service layer surfaces such a collision as a typecheck error, but the signal layer can pass sync/typecheck/build and fail only at runtime — so treat name collisions as errors regardless of whether the build is green.

### Slices, Queries, and Hydration

- A slice's `exec` returns a `QueryOf` (an opaque query descriptor, `pkgs/akanjs/constant/types.ts`); you **cannot** chain `.sort()`/`.limit()` on it.
- Apply ordering/paging via the store `init` fetch option instead: `initX(..., { sort, page, limit })` (`pkgs/akanjs/fetch/fetchType/sliceFetch.type.ts`).
- Generated list accessors like `listBy(...)` return `Promise<Doc[]>`. For a chainable builder (`.sort().skip().limit().select()`) use the model facade's `findMany`/`findOne` (`FindManyChain`, `pkgs/akanjs/document/into.ts`).
- **Hydrated vs raw:** server queries return hydrated `cnst.<Model>` instances (with `set`/`save`/`refresh`); client fetch results are raw `GetStateObject` plain data (functions stripped, `pkgs/akanjs/base/types.ts`).

### Service / Signal Injection

- Injected dependencies resolve by field-name convention: a field named `<refName>Service` resolves to the service registered under `<refName>`, and `<refName>Signal` likewise (`pkgs/akanjs/service/injectInfo.ts`).
- The `Service`/`Signal` suffix is required — the injector strips it to derive the registry lookup key. Name the field after the target refName plus the suffix, not arbitrarily.

## Scalar Modeling (`**/*.constant.ts`)

- Define Akan models in `.constant.ts` files with `via` from `akanjs/constant`.
- Use `Int` for whole-number counts and quantities; use `Float` only for values that need decimals.
- Use `ID` for document references and prefer explicit structured fields over `Any` unless the content is genuinely flexible.
- For date defaults, prefer a function such as `default: () => dayjs()` so the value is created at runtime.
- Follow the established model layering pattern: `Input`, `Object`, `Light<Model>`, full `<Model>`, and `<Model>Insight` when the domain needs those views.

### Scalar & Field Type Reference

- **Import from `akanjs/base`** (real classes/helpers, not globals): `Int`, `Float`, `ID`, `Any`, `Upload`, `enumOf`, and the `dayjs` factory. There is **no `JSON` scalar** — use `Any` for open/flexible payloads.
- **Use the JS globals directly (no import needed)**: `String`, `Boolean`, `Date`. They are monkey-patched to behave like scalars, so `field(String)` typechecks.
- **`Number` is not a valid field/body type.** `NumberConstructor` is intentionally not augmented, so `field(Number)` / `.body("x", Number)` fails to typecheck. Use `Int` or `Float` instead.
- Runtime resolution of every scalar (globals included) goes through `PrimitiveRegistry` by `refName` (`pkgs/akanjs/base/primitiveRegistry.ts`).

### Image & File Fields

- **Do not declare `Upload` as a model field.** `Upload` is a signal-body-only primitive (see Service And Signal Conventions). Models reference the `File` model instead.
- Declare an image/file field as a relation to `File`: `image: field(File).optional()` for one, `images: field([File])` for many (see `libs/shared/lib/user/user.constant.ts`, `libs/shared/lib/banner/banner.constant.ts`).
- The store then auto-generates an `upload<Field>On<Model>(fileList)` action that calls the framework upload mutation and polls file status until it leaves `"uploading"` (`pkgs/akanjs/store/action.ts`).
- Storage is wired through the `StorageAdaptor` DI role (default `BlobStorage`, `pkgs/akanjs/service/predefinedAdaptor/storage.adaptor.ts`); the reference implementation is the `file` lib (`libs/shared/lib/file/*`). Do not hand-roll data-URL fallbacks.

## Akan Page Routing (`apps/**/page/**`)

- `apps/<app>/page` may contain route modules only. Do not add helper logic or component-only files there.
- Route source files under `page/` must use `.tsx`. Do not add `logic.ts`, `.js`, or `.jsx` files under `page/`.
- Route pages use `_index.tsx`; layouts use `_layout.tsx`.
- Reserved `_*.tsx` route filenames are limited to `_index.tsx` and `_layout.tsx`; do not add files like `_Component.tsx` or `_helper.tsx`.
- Page filenames must not start with an uppercase letter. Move helper components like `Component.tsx` to app `ui`, `common`, or `lib` instead.
- Dynamic segments use `[id]`; route groups use directories like `(user)`, `(public)`, `(tab)`, or `(detail)`.
- Page modules should usually export `default`, `pageConfig`, `head`, `generateHead`, or `Loading`.
- Prefer `export default function Page` or `export default async function Page` for page components.
- Before changing route behavior, check `pkgs/akanjs/server/src/routeTree.tsx` and nearby routes for the expected pattern.

## Akan Sync Conventions (`apps/**`, `libs/**`)

- `apps/<appName>` root may only contain these files: `akan.app.json`, `akan.config.ts`, `capacitor.config.ts`, `client.ts`, `main.ts`, `package.json`, `server.ts`, `tsconfig.json`.
- `apps/<appName>` root may only contain these folders: `.akan`, `android`, `common`, `env`, `ios`, `lib`, `page`, `private`, `public`, `script`, `srvkit`, `ui`, `webkit`.
- Do not add `apps/*/base`; place shared app utilities under `apps/*/common`.
- `apps/*/lib` and `libs/*/lib` root files are limited to generated/support files: `cnst.ts`, `db.ts`, `dict.ts`, `option.ts`, `sig.ts`, `srv.ts`, `st.ts`, `useClient.ts`, `useServer.ts`.
- Domain module folders are `lib/<model>` for database modules, `lib/_<service>` for service modules, and `lib/__scalar/<scalar>` for scalar modules.
- Database module UI files are limited to `<Model>.Template.tsx`, `<Model>.Unit.tsx`, `<Model>.Util.tsx`, `<Model>.View.tsx`, and `<Model>.Zone.tsx`.
- Service module UI files are limited to `<Service>.Util.tsx` and `<Service>.Zone.tsx`.
- Scalar module UI files are limited to `<Scalar>.Template.tsx` and `<Scalar>.Unit.tsx`.
- Module `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, `*.spec.ts`, and `*.spec.tsx` files are allowed.
- `ui/index.ts`, `webkit/index.ts`, `srvkit/index.ts`, `common/index.ts`, and module `lib/**/index.ts` files are generated by scanSync; do not hand-edit or track them.
- Generated facet indexes export only 1-depth files/folders with `export * from "./name";`.

## Secrets And Env Safety (`.env`, `infra/**`, `*secret*`, `*credential*`)

- Never print, summarize, commit, or expose real secret values, credentials, tokens, private keys, or `.env` contents.
- If env keys are needed for documentation, list only key names and example placeholders, not live values.
- Preserve the existing env/secret flow through root scripts such as `bun run downloadEnv`, `bun run uploadEnv`, `bun run downloadSecret`, and `bun run uploadSecret`.
- When editing infra env or secret scripts, keep Jenkins and deployment assumptions intact unless the task explicitly asks to change them.
- Treat generated env/secret artifacts as sensitive even when they are not named `.env`.

## Application Test Commands

- After changing application source code, test the app with `bun run akan start <appName>`.
- Test production build generation with `bun run akan build <appName>`.
- To test a built artifact locally, run it from the generated app directory with the required Akan runtime environment variables.

```bash
cd dist/apps/akan && USE_AKANJS_PKGS=true AKAN_PUBLIC_REPO_NAME=akanjs AKAN_PUBLIC_SERVE_DOMAIN="akanjs.com" AKAN_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=akan AKAN_PUBLIC_ENV=local AKAN_PUBLIC_OPERATION_MODE=local SERVER_MODE=federation AKAN_PUBLIC_BASE_PATHS=akanjs,soft,office bun main.js
```

- Adjust `<appName>`, `AKAN_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`, and `AKAN_PUBLIC_BASE_PATHS` to match the app being tested.
